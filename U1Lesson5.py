# given code:
  #import math
  #length = input("Please input a length: ")
  #length = float(length)
  #area = math.pow(length, 2)
  #print("The area of a square of side length", length, "is:", area)

#Predict: 
#I believe that the code above will print the following:
  #Please input a length:
#It will take this input and assign it to the "length" variable and convert the variable to a float. The code will then creat an "area" varaible by putting "length" to the power of 2 and will return the following:
#The area of a square of side length", length, "is:", area

# Run
# My prediction was correct

# Inspect 
# The program stopped execution after the first print statement since it will wait for the user to input a number 
# I inputted the number 2 and it outputted 4.0 which matches with my calculator 

#Modify:
