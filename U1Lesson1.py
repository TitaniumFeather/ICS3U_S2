# this is a code comment
name = "Leslie"
print("Hello", name)

# Predict:
# I think that the code output will print Hello Leslie

# Inspect:
# The output was what I was expecting and there was no comma since it was not included in the string, if you did want a comma you could do print("Hello,", name)

# Modify:
# this is a code comment
name = "Muhammed"
print("Hello,", name)
# This will print Hello, Muhammed
# The variable name is a string that holds the entered name and is used to print Hello, and my name Muhammed
