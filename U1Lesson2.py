#original code:
print(24)

# Predict: 
# I predict that the number 24 will be printed to the console.

# Run:
# My prediction was correct! The output was indeed the number 24.

# Modify:
amount = 24
print("Two dozen is: ", amount)
# Reflection:
# Including "Two dozen is: " in the the code allows the code to have a "goal" in a way, in oppesed to a random number. Additionaly it also makes the code more readable to the user.

#Modify 2:
amount = 7*4
print("twenty-eight is: ", amount)

#Modify 3:
amount = 8
amount = amount + 1
print("The amount is: ", amount)
#Reflection:
#After running the code, "amount = amount + 1" increments the value of "amount" by one and asigns this new value to amoutn. 
#"amount += 1" is a more compact way, but achieves the same thing.

#Modify 3:
amount = 8
amount = amount * 2
print(amount)
#Reflection:
# amount = amount * 2 is taking the value of amount and multiplying it by two, it doubles the value of amount and assigns that as the new value of amount.
# amount *= 2 works the same way but just more compact.
